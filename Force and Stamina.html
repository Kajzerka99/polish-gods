        There is a blue indicator in the lower left corner. The blue indicator tells how many force do you have. With force you can push, pull, grip, jump etc. If you have 0 on indicator you can't use force. If you don't use force you regain it.

        <p><h2 align="center">Stamina</h2></p>
        Also there is a red indicator. It tells how many stamina do you have. It's important because if you don't have stamina and the enemy hit you, you will be killed. You loose stamina by attacking, by being hitted or jumping. If you stay in place or walking with shift you regain stamina.
