        <h2 align="center">Attacking</h2>
            If you want attack to the left side you have to attack and walk in left. If you want damage more you have to walk with shift.
        
        <h2 align="center">Combos</h2>
            If you want make a combo you need to attack in other side. The combo will be stopped when the enemy will slap or perfect blocked you.

        <h2 align="center">Slaps</h2>
            In Saber Showdown there is an attack named slap. If you slapped an enemy that didn't block you will make him lay down. When you are slapped, and go in front, (and if enemy isn't blocking) you will jump on enemy and he will be slapped so remember to block when he is jumping. When you go left, right or back you will just move from him.
